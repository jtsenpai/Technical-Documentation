            Web development refers to the creation and maintenance of websites
            and web applications. It involves a variety of technologies and
            languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web
            development frameworks and tools. In this documentation, we will
            provide an overview of web development, including its history, key
            concepts, and common technologies and tools used in the field.

            The history of web development dates back to the early 1990s, when
            the World Wide Web was first created by Tim Berners-Lee. The first
            web page was created in 1991, and the first web browser, called
            WorldWideWeb, was released in 1993. From there, the web grew
            rapidly, with the first commercial websites appearing in the
            mid-1990s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, web development has evolved significantly. In the
            early days, web pages were simple, static documents with basic
            formatting and links. Today, web development involves complex web
            applications with rich user interfaces, data processing, and
            sophisticated back-end systems.

            Client-side development refers to the creation of the user interface
            and interactive features that run in the user's web browser. This
            includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as various front-end
            frameworks and libraries.

            Server-side development refers to the creation of the back-end
            systems that power a web application. This includes the database,
            server-side scripting languages such as PHP or Python, and various
            back-end frameworks and tools.

            Full-stack development refers to the ability to work on both the
            client-side and server-side of a web application. A full-stack
            developer is someone who can build both the user interface and the
            back-end systems that power it.
